# Enter the build environment

In order to enter the build environment (to use the needed Bash functions
for building), follow these steps:
1. Start a Bash. (Other shells are currently not supported, and are not
   scheduled to support)
2. Run `source build_system/env.sh`.
3. Run needed operations in this Bash.
